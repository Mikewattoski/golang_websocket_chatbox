# Real-Time Chat Application

## Overview

This project is a Real-Time Chat Application built using **Golang** for the backend, **WebSockets** for real-time communication, and **React.js** for the frontend. The application is containerized using **Docker** and served via **Nginx** as a reverse proxy.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Golang, WebSockets
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Web Server:** Nginx

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication:** Supports thousands of concurrent users with minimal latency using WebSockets.
- **Responsive UI:** Frontend built with React.js for a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Microservices architecture enables flexible deployment and scaling.
- **Secure:** Deployed behind an Nginx reverse proxy for enhanced security.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Golang**: [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Initialize Submodules

If the frontend is added as a submodule, initialize it:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Build and run the Go server:

    ```bash
    go build -o chat-server .
    ./chat-server
    ```

### 4. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies and start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

### 5. Docker Setup

To run the entire application using Docker:

1. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Nginx Configuration

Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate service (frontend or backend). The configuration is located in the `nginx/default.conf` file.

## Accessing the Application

- **Frontend:** The React.js application can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Backend API:** The Golang WebSocket server listens on `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
